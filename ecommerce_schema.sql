## SOLVING

# 1. Write a query to find the customer name who have placed orders amount more than 500
select customer_name from customers c join orders o on c.customer_id=o.customer_id where order_amount > 500;

# 2. Find the most recently ordered product by each customer?
select customer_name, max(order_date) as RecentOrder from customers c join orders o using(customer_id) group by customer_name;

# 3. Find the most frequently ordered product by each customer? Note: most frequently ordered means the highest volume ordered
with temp as( select customer_id, product_id, sum(quantity) as total_quantity from orders group by customer_id,product_id), RankedProducts as
(select customer_id, product_id, total_quantity, rank() over(partition by customer_id order by total_quantity desc) as Ranks from temp) 
select customer_id, product_id as most_frequent_product, total_quantity as highest_quantity from RankedProducts where Ranks = 1;

# 4. List the names of suppliers who supply products in 'Category 2â€™. (try using join and subquery separately)
# by join
select supplier_name,category_name,product_name from suppliers s join products p using(supplier_id) join categories c using(category_id) where category_name='Category 2';
# by subquery
select supplier_name from suppliers where supplier_id in(select supplier_id from products where category_id in(select category_id from categories
where category_name='Category 2'));

# 5. List the employees who are working on more than one project.    # since its more than one use count
select employee_id,employee_name from employees e where employee_id in(select employee_id from employee_projects group by employee_id having count(project_id)>1);

# 6. Display the customer name along with number of orders and total amount paid   # number fo orders means take count
select customer_name, count(order_id) as NumberofOrders, sum(order_amount) as TotalAmtPaid from customers c join orders o on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
group by customer_name;

# 7. List the top 3 products that have generated the highest revenue.
select product_name,sum(order_amount * quantity) as HighestRevenue from products p join orders o on p.product_id=o.product_id group by product_name
